<p>Dear %%[ if not empty(@fname) then ]%%%%= v(@fname) =%%%%[ else ]%%Friend%%[ endif ]%%,</p>

<p>I wanted to see if you are interested in getting involved with a really interesting group that is coming together right now.</p>
 
<p>You live in a town served by a light plant utility instead of an investor owned utility like Eversource. This means that you have a really great opportunity to get involved in clean energy and can help make your whole townâ€™s energy mix more sustainable. There is a lot going on with Municipal Light Plants (Munis) in terms of green energy right now and I hope you will get involved.</p>
 
<p>There is a statewide group of people from light plant towns in Massachusetts that has started coming together and meeting to share ideas and good models. A group of more than 50 people from 21 Muni towns attended a meeting in September. There, advocates (like you) and experts talked about issues around clean energy that is unique to residents of light plant towns.</p>

<p>We are looking for renewable energy advocates from %%=v(@city)=%% and a few other towns to join the next meeting. Oriana Reilly (<a href="orianareilly@massclimateaction.net">orianareilly@massclimateaction.net</a>) from Mass Climate Action will be in touch with details, but I hope you can go to the next scheduled meeting with Green Muni Town members on <strong>January 27th</strong>.</p>
