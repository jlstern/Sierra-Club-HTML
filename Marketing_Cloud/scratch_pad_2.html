<p>Great news - your efforts paid off! The Boston City Council voted <strong>unanimously</strong> on Wednesday to authorize the implementation of a Community Choice Energy program here in Boston. This means all Boston residents will soon have access to more renewable energy!</p>

<p><em>Now it is up to Mayor Marty Walsh to implement it.</em></p>

<p>Please let Mayor Walsh know that you support Community Choice Energy by calling his office at (617) 635-4500 and saying “My name is [name] and I live at [address]. I would like Mayor Walsh to know that I strongly support Community Choice Energy and would like him to move forward on it as soon as possible. I am very worried about climate change and its impacts on Boston.”</p>

<p><strong>MOST PEOPLE NEVER CALL THE MAYOR - SO HE WILL DEFINITELY NOTICE THESE CALLS.</strong></p>

<p>It is also important to thank the Boston City Councilors for their leadership. Click here to send a thank you note to all thirteen councilors.</p>

<p><strong>Thank You Note to Councilors</strong><br>
Thank you so much for supporting Community Choice Energy in Boston! Please continue your efforts to make the City of Boston a climate leader. Let’s transition as quickly as possible off fossil fuels entirely, and get to 100% renewable energy!</p>

<p><strong>What’s Community Choice Energy?</strong><br>
Implementing a community choice energy program will authorize Boston to purchase electricity on behalf of its residents and small businesses. By taking advantage of bulk purchasing negotiating power, the city would be able to require a higher percentage of renewable energy, above and beyond the level required by law. If implemented, this program would also help to stabilize energy prices in the City and provide market incentives for renewable energy projects in Massachusetts and New England.
