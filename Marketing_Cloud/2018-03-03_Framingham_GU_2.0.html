	<p>Dear %%[ if not empty(@fname) then ]%%%%= v(@fname) =%%%%[ else ]%%Friend%%[ endif ]%%,</p>

	<h4>We are pleased to let you know about a great event hosted by our friends in Framingham coming up on March 10th!</h4>

	<p>Come together to help create a more sustainable, resilient Framingham.</p>

	<ul><em>
		<li>Is there a project that you have dreamed up that is too big for you to take on alone?</li>
		<li>Do you have a great idea but you need help with specific skills to bring it to life?</li>
		<li>Maybe you just want to come hear other people's ideas or share your own wisdom.</li>
	</em></ul>

	<p>During this event we will use a facilitation methodology called Open Space Technology to have a large group brainstorm bigger ways that we can all work together to make Framingham more sustainable and resilient.</p>

	<p>After the brainstorm each person will vote on their favorite ideas with the most voted ones being awarded break out sessions to go deeper into the viability of the idea.</p>

	<p>After the breakout sessions we will get back together to hear reports from the sessions. We will create working groups for ideas that have sufficient viability and momentum with the goal of working in groups to make Framingham a greener place to live, work and play.</p>

	<p>

		<strong>WHEN:</strong> Saturday, March 10 at 1:30pm<br>
