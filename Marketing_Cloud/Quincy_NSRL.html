	<p><strong>What's the North South Rail Link?</strong><br>
	Boston is served by two commuter rail systems, one extending to the north of the city, the other to the south. They are disconnected from each other, and neither connects fully to our subway system.  The result is a fragmented region in which workers and employers cannot access each other efficiently, where highway congestion is severe, and economic opportunity is very unequally distributed. The North South Rail Link is a proposed pair of 1.5 mile-long tunnels that would connect the MBTA's North Station and South Station, allowing for more efficient travel and would reduce carbon emissions. According to the <a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/www.sierraclub.org/files/sce-authors/u3922/2003-06%20NSRL%20DEIR%20Major%20Investment%20Study.PDF">Rail Link's 2003 Draft Environmental Report/Major Investment Study</a>, the Rail Link would result in over 55,000 auto trips diverted daily onto public transportation.</p>

	<p>Hope to see you Wednesday night!</p>
