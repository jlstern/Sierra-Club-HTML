	<p>Good morning friends,</p>

	<p>This message is to let you know about a great event coming up on Monday for any teenagers interested environmental and climate issues.</p>

	<p><strong>WHAT:</strong> Harnessing the Unique Power of Teens to Advance Climate Legislation Class<br>
	<strong>WHEN:</strong> Monday, January 8, 3:30-6:30pm<br>
	<strong>WHERE:</strong> Hitchcock Center for the Environment, 845 West Street, Amherst, MA</p>

	<p>This event is free, but an <a href="https://truthschool.org/classes/winter-2018/010818har/#register">REGISTRATION IS REQUIRED</a>.</p>

	<p>Teens are uniquely positioned to lobby legislators on crucial climate legislation. When they face teens, legislators realize they are facing the future! You will learn the basics of our Massachusetts legislature – state government 101, the key political players, current climate-related bills – practice the best communication strategies for influencing one’s elected officials, and make a plan to lobby your representative. Be inspired by teen graduates of the training who have lobbied successfully and will assist you as peer mentors.</p>

	<p>Learn from Rep. Solomon Goldstein-Rose, age 23, the youngest representative in the MA State House, who built his political campaign on the platform of transforming Massachusetts into a clean energy center for the world. We will serve a substantial, healthy, and delicious snack.</p>
