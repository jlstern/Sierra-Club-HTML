	<p>Firstly, we want to alert you about the upcoming <strong>hearing on a plastic bag ban</strong> for the upcoming Westborough Annual Town Meeting. We need your help now (and your vote later in March)!</p>

	<p>The hearing will be held <strong>Wednesday, January 17 at 2 p.m. at Town Hall.</strong></p>

	<p>This proposed by-law will reduce plastic waste in your community as it has already in Shrewsbury and shortly in Grafton.</p>

	<p>The Massachusetts Sierra Club strongly endorses a comprehensive law on plastic bags. In the past six years, 60 Massachusetts municipalities have enacted and successfully implemented laws and regulations to restrict plastic bags. The law will accelerate the growing trend towards reusable bags, and also allow sustainable bags that are made of paper, which is a natural, biodegradable and renewable material.</p>

	<p>Plastic bags are composed of petrochemicals derived from non-renewable, fracked natural gas and oil. The production of polyethylene is a messy, toxic process. Westborough residents are estimated to use 6 million polyethylene shopping bags per year. Bags cannot be recycled conveniently, and are usually turned into non-recyclable plastic lumber when they are. That is why people typically return bags at the extremely low rate of 5%. Eliminating such non-biodegradable secondary packaging will not only reduce waste, it will also beautify the Town by reducing the unsightly and ultimately permanent litter that these plastic products are causing. As litter, bags directly harm animals on land and as they travel in the town's rivers to the Atlantic ocean.</p>

	<p>Secondly, we want to alert you to an upcoming public information session on establishing Westborough as a <strong>Green Community</strong>. 210 Massachusetts communities have already been designated as Green Communities, and we want to make Westborough next!  This designation will allow us to apply for grants to offset the capital costs of lowering our Town energy use and using more forms of clean energy.</p>

	<p>The Green Community status public information session will be held <strong>Tuesday, January 16th at 7 p.m. at Town Hall.</strong></p>

	<p><strong>We hope you can attend these hearings, and then plan to come vote at Town Meeting on March 17!</strong></p>

	<p>If you are interested in volunteering with the Sierra Club, or have any other questions, please respond to this email.</p>

	<p>Thank you!</p>

	<p>Sincerely,</p>
