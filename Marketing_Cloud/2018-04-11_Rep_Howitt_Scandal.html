	<p>Dear %%[ if not empty(@fname) then ]%%%%= v(@fname) =%%%%[ else ]%%Friend%%[ endif ]%%,</p>

	<p>This <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gas-pipeline-lobbyist-email_us_5abd0f85e4b03e2a5c7a57b8">March 29 article</a> broke the news that State Rep. Steve Howitt - <em>your representative</em> -- blind copied a fracked gas lobbyist while responding via email to a constituent expressing opposition to new fracked gas pipelines in Massachusetts. </p>

	<p>Not only that, but when the lobbyist hit “reply all” thereby outing himself as having been on a blind copy, Rep. Howitt lied and claimed the lobbyist was a government official!</p>

	<p><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gas-pipeline-lobbyist-email_us_5abd0f85e4b03e2a5c7a57b8">The article</a> notes that the lobbyist congratulated Rep. Howitt:</p>

	<p><em>“Perfect response to her, Steve,” he wrote, adding a link to a study that he said “really does a good job if [sic] explaining the power problem we have and how problematic the inadequate supply of natural gas is to our region.”</em></p>

	<p>It is clear from this incident that <strong>Rep. Howitt’s loyalties lie with the fracked gas industry,</strong> rather than his constituents who are concerned about climate change.</p>

	<p>Especially representing a coastal district more vulnerable to climate change, Rep. Howitt should know that Mass. needs to be leading the way on more clean energy such as <strong>solar, wind and energy efficiency,</strong> NOT more fracked gas which contributes to global warming. </p>

	<p><strong>Please call</strong> Rep. Howitt’s office at 617-722-2305 and tell him “My name is _____, I live at [address], and I’m really disappointed to see Rep. Howitt cozying up to fracked gas lobbyists. I expect him to be looking out for me and my family, not for fossil fuel lobbyists.”</p>

	<p>Or if you’d rather you can also email him at <a href="mailto:Steven.Howitt@mahouse.gov">Steven.Howitt@mahouse.gov</a>.</p>
