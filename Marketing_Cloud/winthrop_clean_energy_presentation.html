	<p>Dear %%[ if not empty(@fname) then ]%%%%= v(@fname) =%%%%[ else ]%%Friend%%[ endif ]%%,</p>
	<p>Please join the Massachusetts Sierra Club, the Friends of Belle Isle Marsh, Mothers Out Front, and Air, Inc. for a presentation on <strong>&quot;Local and State Leadership on Climate Change in the Trump Era.&quot;</strong></p>
	<p>A presentation by Emily Norton, our Massachusetts Chapter Director, will bring you up to speed on key state level clean energy bills under consideration on Beacon Hill, as well as opportunities for local and regional action. She will give you the tools you need to effectively advocate to your elected officials.</p>
	<p>The presentation will start at 7:15pm and will include an opportunity for Q&amp;A. This event is free and open to the public. Light refreshments available.</p>
	<p><strong>WHEN:</strong> <em>Tuesday, November 14th at 7:00pm</em></p>
	<p><strong>WHERE:</strong> <em>Orient Heights Yacht Club, 61 Bayswater Street, East Boston, MA 02128</em></p>
	<p>Lacking true support for the environment from this federal administration, what we do at the state, regional and local level is more important than ever. Massachusetts and %%=v(@city)=%% must continue to be clean energy leaders.</p>
	<p>Don't miss this chance to hear about what YOU can do to push for climate solutions locally and in the Commonwealth.</p>
	<p>As always, thank you for all that you do!</p>
