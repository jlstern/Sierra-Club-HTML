<div style="font-size: 13px;"><p>Dear Friend,</p>

<p style="color: red;"><strong>This is not an e-blast or fundraising appeal, but a personal outreach from a fellow Sierra Club member. I appreciate you taking the time to read this!</strong></p>

<p>With our climate crisis looming and the chance of passing climate change policy at the national level dimming, I am volunteering with the Sierra Club to contact fellow members who live in strategic MA legislative districts. We are at a critical point in passing meaningful climate legislation, including a bill that would put a price on carbon emissions.</p>

 <p>You’re a constituent of <strong><a href="https://malegislature.gov/Legislators/Profile/BWM1">MA Representative Brian Murray</a></strong>. We need your help in working with your legislator--you have a chance to make a difference. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeE8xbySk_hMXBEZQvgMCNUucxBeLjaJNQAuWJwqn4rocqOdw/viewform">Please click here if this already sounds interesting to you!</a></p>

 <p>State and national legislators and lobbying trainers have taught me that personal relationships with legislators are extremely important. Utility company lobbyists are in the statehouse all the time building these relationships. In the absence of constituents appealing to them, our elected officials risk considering the perspective of paid industry lobbyists over the needs of their voters. </p>

<p style="color: red;"><strong>That’s where you come in, so here’s my "ask:"</strong></p>

<p>Would you be interested in joining a team of constituents that would meet with Rep. Murray in his district office to advocate for the passage of some of the most important climate bills currently before the legislature?</p>

<p>You do not have to be an expert on these bills. We will help prepare you and you can choose your role in the meeting. Personal stories and reasons for caring about climate work well. We will be there to answer technical questions about the bills.</p>

<p>Two examples of Sierra Club legislative priorities are the two carbon pricing bill (<a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/190/H1726">H 1726 sponsored by Rep. Benson</a>) and a bill that increases the amount of renewable energy allowed on the grid (<a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/190/H2700">H. 2700 sponsored by Rep. Khan</a>).</p>

<p>I’ll speak firsthand in assuring you that you do not need to be an expert. You simply need to urge your representative ​in person​ to actively support aggressive climate legislation this legislative session.</p>

<p><strong>We will support you at every step</strong>--in planning for the meeting, sharing strategies, and helping to schedule the meeting. Every public voice matters, but some voices--- like yours as a direct constituent--carry more weight than others.</p>

<p>If you would like to find out more or you are interested in being part of a constituent team please fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeE8xbySk_hMXBEZQvgMCNUucxBeLjaJNQAuWJwqn4rocqOdw/viewform">this short volunteer form</a>.</p>

<p>Please also feel free to call or email me.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br>
