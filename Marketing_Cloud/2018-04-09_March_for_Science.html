	<p>Dear %%[ if not empty(@fname) then ]%%%%= v(@fname) =%%%%[ else ]%%Friend%%[ endif ]%%,</p>

	<p>The Massachusetts Sierra Club is supporting the <strong>2018 March for Science in Boston</strong> on April 14, and we’re hoping to see you there!</p>

	<p>The theme of this year’s Boston march is <strong><em>“Science Strikes Back!”</em></strong> While last year’s March for Science celebrated the importance of science, it focused mostly on defending science from attacks on scientific credibility and funding cuts by federal agencies. This year, the focus is on being proactive—advocating for science-based public policy and getting more people involved in science. In particular, the spotlight will be on <strong>climate change</strong>, where the science so needs to be heard.</p>

	<p>We will be rallying in Boston’s <a target="_blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/sT62Z3gnH662">Christopher Columbus Park</a> on Saturday, April 14th. There will be speakers and information about how science impacts our lives and informs public policy.</p>

	<p>We believe it's important to support this event and show support for the scientist and researchers who are working diligently behind the scenes to help transition our world to a clean energy economy. So please join us, and bring your friends and family. <a target="_blank" href="https://sierra.secure.force.com/events/details?formcampaignid=7010Z000001PKhVQAW">Click here to RSVP and march with the MA Sierra Club!</a></p>

	<p>
		<strong>WHAT:</strong> Speakers, tables, playground, waterfront, friendly people<br>
		<strong>WHEN:</strong> Saturday, April 14, 1:00–3:00pm<br>
		<strong>WHERE:</strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/sT62Z3gnH662">Christopher Columbus Park</a>, Boston<br>
		<em>(3-minute walk from the Aquarium Station off the Blue Line or an 8-minute walk from Haymarket or State Street Stations off the Green/Orange Lines)</em><br>
		<strong>WHY:</strong> Because science deserves our energetic support!
	</p>

	<p>Big shoutout to <strong>350MA for a Better Future</strong> for organizing this event!</p>

	<p>Sincerely,</p>
