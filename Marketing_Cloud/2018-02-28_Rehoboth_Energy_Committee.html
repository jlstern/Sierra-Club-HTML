<p>As a fellow Sierra Club member and resident of Rehoboth, I am excited to tell you that the Rehoboth Board of Selectmen has authorized a <strong>new town committee for “Green Energy”</strong> and I am inviting you to join. The committee will work to achieve the <a href="https://www.mass.gov/guides/becoming-a-designated-green-community">Green Community designation</a> for the Town, under the guidelines of the MA Department of Energy Resources. This work will enable the Town to meet the statewide goals for energy efficiency and renewable energy, and also to save money as well as bring new grant resources into the Town. Here is a link to the state website: <a href="https://www.mass.gov/orgs/green-communities-division">https://www.mass.gov/orgs/green-communities-division</a>.</p>

<p>I have been appointed to chair the Green Energy Committee and to <strong>identify residents to join in this effort</strong>. If you may be interested, I ask that you <a href="mailto:carolyn.panofsky@gmail.com">contact me</a> by Saturday, March 10.  If you’d like to chat about what’s involved, I’m happy to give you a call to answer any questions.</p>

<p>I look forward to hearing from you soon!</p>
