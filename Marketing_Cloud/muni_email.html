	<p>Dear %%[ if not empty(@fname) then ]%%%%= v(@fname) =%%%%[ else ]%%Friend%%[ endif ]%%,</p>
	<p>You are receiving this email because %%=v(@city)=%% is one of ~50 towns in Massachusetts that receives its electricity from a  Municipal Light Plant (MLP). There are 41 MLPs in Massachusetts today and electricity generated from these plants cover about 15% of customers in the Commonwealth.</p>
	<h3>What is a Municipal Light Plant (MLP)?</h3>
	<p>MLPs are municipally-owned utilities. This might sound familair because you probably receive your power from a local light plant utility instead of an investor owned utility like Eversource. In many ways MLPs function similarly to larger Investor Owned Utilities (IOUs), but there are some key differences. First, in Massachusetts IOUs cover large regions of the state. MLPs, by contrast, serve just one or a handful of towns. Second, MLPs are not subject to the same laws as IOUs, namely the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS).</p>
	<p>Massachusetts Renewable Portfolio Standard is a requirement for our Investor Owned Utilities to maintain an annual increase in the percentage of renewable energy generated for our grid. MLPs are EXEMPT from the RPS and not eligible for many of the associated funds unless they choose to opt into the same IOU standards.</p>
	<h3>What can I do to bring more renewable energy to %%=v(@city)=%%?</h3>
	<p>There are options for MLPs participate in renewable energy generation and <a href="https://vimeo.com/228976054">some have already begun moving in that direction.</a> Recently the state Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) proposed better clean energy policies that include MLPs. Unfortunately, more than a third of the MLP boards submitted comments to the state saying they disagreed with being included in the Clean Energy Standard. The DEP needs to hear from people in their towns that you care about clean energy and want them to do better.</p>
	<div style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px">
		<p><strong>Please email the DEP at <a href="mailto:climate.strategies@state.ma.us">climate.strategies@state.ma.us</a> to urge them to include MLPs in the standards:</strong></p>
		<p><em>As a resident of %%=v(@city)=%%, I have become aware of the stakeholders sessions that the Department of Environmental Protection is holding in regards to the inclusion of Municipal Light Plants (MLPs) in the Clean Energy Standard.</em></p>
		<p><em>I write to urge you to include MLP’s in the Clean Energy Standard and encourage light plants to plan for a steady integration of renewable energy resources, with a priority on Class I renewables. MLPs should be a part of commonwealth’s solution to climate change and not be exempted.</em></p>
