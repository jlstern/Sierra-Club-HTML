<p>Dear %%[ if not empty(@fname) then ]%%%%= v(@fname) =%%%%[ else ]%%Friend%%[ endif ]%%,</p>

<p style="color: red;"><strong>This is a personal outreach email from a fellow Sierra Club member to others living in State Representative Jerald Parisella’s district about how you can help pass critical climate change legislation by signing onto a letter. Thank you for reading!</strong></p>

<p>Sierra Club volunteers recently met with Rep. Parisella, Chair of the Joint Committee on Public Service, in Beverly -  to urge him to support the fossil fuel divestment bill, H.3281, which is in that committee. Since that time, the committee decided to extended the time to consider the bill until May 31.</p>

<p>We urge you to sign the letter to Rep. Parisella, below, to urge him to give the fossil fuel divestment bill a favorable report as soon as possible. As Chair of the Committee, he has great influence over the bill, and as his constituents, you have influence over him. <strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/u/1/d/1tkvW4YrolOJDGhAAeIlKubYuO673YJKXZ_k-DuH6qyI/viewform" target="_blank">Click here to add your name to the letter.</strong></a></p>

<p>In addition, please copy and paste this email to friends and colleagues in Beverly to get even more support.</p>

<p>Here is the text of the letter:</p>

<div style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 10px; padding: 10px;"><em>
	<p>Dear Chairman Parisella,</p>
	<p>As your constituents, we strongly urge you to give a favorable report to H.3281, the fossil fuel divestment bill. The bill would require immediate divestment of Massachusetts state pension funds from holdings in coal, and create a Commission that would provide a path to divest from gas and oil.</p>
	<p>At a time when the fossil fuel industry is being handed an unprecedented amount of power by the Trump administration, and our own Attorney General is investigating the industry for a pattern of deception, we must stand up for Massachusetts values and divest from fossil fuels.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>We have an obligation to future generations to minimize the impact of climate change. Divestment sends a strong message that our children’s future comes first!</li>
		<li>Divestment is absolutely consistent with Massachusetts’ priorities. We have passed legislation to promote renewable energy such as the Green Communities Act, the Global Warming Solutions Act and Massachusetts participates in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.</li>
		<li>Divestment is a sound financial strategy. Investment professionals are increasingly concerned about financial risk associated with the fossil fuel industry.</li>
		<li>Divestment is a proven tool for change. This legislation is modeled on successful legislation that led to divestment of the state pension fund from financial interests in Iran. Previous legislative efforts successfully divested the pension fund from South Africa, Sudan, and tobacco.</li>

	</ul>

	<p>We urge you to use your leadership to pass H.3281, the fossil fuel divestment bill during this legislative session.</p>

	<p>Sincerely,</p>

	<p>{Your name here}
