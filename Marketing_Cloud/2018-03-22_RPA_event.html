	<p style="font-size: 18px"><em>About the MA Sierra Club Transporation Committee</em></p>

	<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.sierraclub.org/massachusetts/transportation">The Transportation Committee of the Mass. Sierra Club</a> has been active on many issues around the state. We've attended meetings and hearings on Green Line Extension, I-90 Interchange, South Coast Rail, the Berkshire Flyer, North South Rail Link and the state rail plan. We've submitted official testimony. We're opposing cuts to our regional transit agencies and raising fares on the T. We support increasing service on commuter rail inside Boston to rapid transit levels on the Framingham and Fairmount lines. We support electric buses and trains.</p>

	<p>If you have anything you'd like us to know about or would like to get involved <a href="mailto:crbrookline@aol.com?subject=Sierra%20Club%20Transportation%20Committee">let us know</a>. We could use everyone's help to improve regional mobility and make transportation more sustainable. Your voice can make a difference. If interested, our next Transportation Comm. meeting is <strong>Thursday, May 10 at 6 PM at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/50+Federal+St,+Boston,+MA+02110/@42.3558798,-71.0585955,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89e37083e8acd597:0xe9c0dd5f82d0c8e5!8m2!3d42.3558798!4d-71.0564015">Sierra Club Boston office (50 Federal St, 3rd Floor)</a></strong>.</p>
