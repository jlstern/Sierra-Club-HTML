<p style="color: red;">This is a personal outreach email from a fellow Sierra Club member and volunteer. This is an email to fellow Sierra Club members living in MA Rep. Jerald Parisella’s district about how you can help lobby him on critical climate change legislation.  Thank you for reading!</p>

<p>Fellow Sierra Club volunteers have secured a constituent meeting with Rep. Parisella’s office hours on Thurs. Feb. 1 at 5 PM at Beverly City Hall, 191 Cabot St, Beverly.</p>

<p><strong>Will you join fellow constituents on Feb. 1 to urge Rep. Parisella to support Climate bills this session?</strong> We are especially focusing on:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Renewable Portfolio Standard increase by at least 3% (<a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/190/H2700">H.2700</a>, as amended)</li>
	<li>Divestment of the state pension fund from coal (<a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/190/H3281">H.3281</a>), (Rep. Parisella is House Chair of the Public Service Committee, where that bill was assigned.)</li>
</ul>

<p>For those able, we will be meeting in advance of the meeting - at 3:45 -  to prep. I will be sending out more information early next week about where we will meet. We will also be providing information and talking points about the bills.</p>
