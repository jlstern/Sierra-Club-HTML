	<p>Dear %%[ if not empty(@fname) then ]%%%%= v(@fname) =%%%%[ else ]%%Friend%%[ endif ]%%,</p>

	<p>Why is the Sierra Club asking you to contact your legislator about gun safety? Because Sierra Club's mission commits us to protect and restore the quality of the human and natural environment using all means available.</p>

	<p>While the tragedy in Florida is receiving national attention - and rightly so - too many communities right here in Massachusetts live in fear from gun violence on a daily basis.</p>

	<p>We can be proud that Massachusetts has the <a href="https://www.bostonmagazine.com/health/2017/01/11/massachusetts-gun-death-rate/" target="_blank">lowest gun death rate in the nation</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/06/opinion/how-to-reduce-shootings.html" target="_blank">earns an A grade among states</a>. But even one preventable death is too many. There is more we can do to keep guns from those who should not have them.</p>

	<p>State Representative Marjorie Decker from Cambridge has filed <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/190/H3610" target="_blank">H.3610, An Act temporarily preventing firearm access for extremely dangerous or suicidal individuals</a>.</p>

	<p>This bill would create an Extreme Risk Protection Order (ERPO), a kind of court order that family members and law enforcement can request to temporarily restrict a person's access to guns because they pose a significant danger to themselves or others. When family members are empowered to act, they can prevent warning signs from turning into a mass shooting or gun suicide.</p>

	<p><a href="https://sierra.secure.force.com/actions/Massachusetts?actionId=AR0107237&id=7010Z000001PGvJQAW&data=%%=v(@ptoken)=%%">Please take action TODAY</a> to urge your state legislators to contact the members of the Joint Committee on Public Safety &amp; Homeland Security and ask them to move the bill out of Committee, so it can be voted on by the entire legislature and passed into law.</p>

	<h4>And then please join us at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1607397545975790/" target="_blank">March 24 March for our Lives</a> on Boston Common starting at noon! <a href="mailto:emily.norton@sierraclub.org">Contact us</a> if you’d like to march with Mass. Sierra Club.</h4>

		<p>Dear ____,</p>

		<p>I urge you to support Rep. Marjorie Decker’s H.3610, An Act temporarily preventing firearm access for extremely dangerous or suicidal individuals. This bill would create an Extreme Risk Protection Order (ERPO), a kind of court order that family members and law enforcement can request to temporarily restrict a person's access to guns because they pose a significant danger to themselves or others. When family members are empowered to act, they can prevent warning signs from turning into a mass shooting or gun suicide.</p>

		<p>We can be proud that Massachusetts has the <a href="https://www.bostonmagazine.com/health/2017/01/11/massachusetts-gun-death-rate/" target="_blank">lowest gun death rate in the nation</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/06/opinion/how-to-reduce-shootings.html" target="_blank">earns an A grade among states</a>. But even one preventable death is too many. There is more we can do to keep guns from those who should not have them.</p>

		<p>Please contact the members of the Joint Committee on Public Safety &amp; Homeland Security, especially the House and Senate leaders of the Committee, and ask them to move the bill out of Committee, so it can be voted on by the entire legislature and passed into law.</p>

		<p>Sincerely,</p>

		<p>(Your name here)</p>
