	<p>Dear %%[ if not empty(@fname) then ]%%%%= v(@fname) =%%%%[ else ]%%Friend%%[ endif ]%%,</p>

	<p>This is an invitation to a great event coming up on January 25th.</p>

	<p>Join us to support the Bears Ears National Monument! Trump’s plan to significantly reduce the size of Bears Ears in Utah for oil and coal mining purposes can not go unprotested. More than 85% of Bears Ears National Monument would be eliminated. This action is part of a larger effort from the Trump Administration to sell out America’s public lands and waters to fossil fuel development.</p>

	<p style="color: #CA6F1E"><em>Join the Massachusetts Chapter for a presentation by Sierra Club member Harvey Halpern about the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase Escalante National Monuments in Utah.</em></p>

	<p>
		<strong>WHEN: </strong>January 25th 6:30-7:30pm<br>
		<strong>WHERE: </strong>MA Sierra Club Offices, 50 Federal St, 3rd Floor, Boston, MA 02110
	</p>

	<p>Please <a target="_blank" href="https://sierra.secure.force.com/events/details?formcampaignid=7010Z000001P29TQAS">RSVP here</a>, IT IS REQUIRED</p>

	<p>(Free and open to the public)</p>

	<p><strong>About the presenter:</strong><br>
	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.harveyhalpern.com/">Harvey Halpern</a> been hiking in the most remote parts of Utah’s canyon country for nearly 40 years. He specializes in off-trail long trips, upwards to 33 days. He has been part of numerous first descents of technical canyons, has named canyons and even has a canyon named after him (Hard Day Harvey).</p>

	<p><strong>Join the effort:</strong><br> 
	President Trump does not have the legal authority to eliminate sections of Bears Ears. HOWEVER, only congress can establish a National Conservation Area, meaning that protection for Bears Ears is far from certain.</p>

	<p>Bears Ears is <strong>only the first of many</strong> National Monuments that are under threat by the Trump Administration. Two monuments in Maine and Massachusetts are under revision as well.</p>

	<p>We Sierra Club love our national monuments both Bears Ears and others and <strong>we stand with the overwhelming majority of Americans</strong> in opposing these attacks on our history, favorite outdoor pastimes and cultural and natural treasures. </p>
