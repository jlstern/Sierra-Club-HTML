	<p>Dear Friend,</p>

	<p>The Boston City Council will be voting on a plastic bag ban this coming <strong>Wednesday, Nov. 29th.</strong></p>

	<p>Boston residents are estimated to use over 200 million polyethylene shopping bags per year. There is no excuse for single-use shopping bags made of petrochemicals derived from non-renewable, fracked natural gas and oil.</p>


	<p>Boston is the largest municipality in New England. Fifty-nine cities and towns in Massachusetts have already banned plastic bags. <strong>Let's make Boston the 60th!</strong></p>

	<p>Here are some of the reasons why we should ban plastic bags...</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Bags are made from fossil fuels so contribute to our dependence on petroleum.</li>
		<li>They are a major litter problem, thanks especially to their aerodynamic qualities.</li>
		<li>Plastic bags can break recycling equipment, costing the city money and time to repair.</li>
		<li>They are dangerous to both domestic and wild animals, who eat them and die.</li>
		<li>As part of the ordinance outreach, free reusable bags will be distributed in low-income areas and to seniors. As Councilor Pressley points out, low-income communities suffer the most from trash due to single-use bags and shouldnâ€™t be used as an excuse not to ban plastic bags.</li>
		<li>Plastic bags didn't exist until the 1970s. We all managed just fine without them.</li>
		<li>Furthermore, recycling cannot solve the waste problem, because it is inconvenient and has resulted in return rates of only 5%.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>We need your help! Use the "<a href="https://sierra.secure.force.com/actions/Massachusetts?actionId=AR0095798">Take Action</a>" link to email your City Councilors! Additionally, please join us to show support at the Boston City Council meeting at <strong>12pm this Wednesday, November 29th at Boston City Hall.</strong></p>

	<p>As always, thanks for all you do.</p>
