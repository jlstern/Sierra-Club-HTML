	<p>Dear friends,</p>

	<p style="color: red;"><strong>This is not an e-blast or fundraising appeal, but a personal outreach from a fellow Sierra Club member. I appreciate your taking the time to read this!</strong></p>

	<p>I am reaching out because you are a consituent of <strong><a href="https://malegislature.gov/Legislators/Profile/BWM1">MA State Rep. Brian Murray</a></strong>. There is a lot you can do to help pass important climate legislation in Massachusetts. Please join other constituents of Rep. Murray in a meeting with him <strong> this Sunday, Jan. 7 at 10am in his Milford office.</strong></p>

	<p><strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeE8xbySk_hMXBEZQvgMCNUucxBeLjaJNQAuWJwqn4rocqOdw/viewform">Can you join us?</a></strong></p>

	<p>You can make a difference! For example, we are at a critical point with carbon pricing legislation. We only need 11 more representatives to have a majority of the House support carbon pricing.</p>

	<p>You do not need to know much about this legislation. You only need to care about climate change and be willing to give up part of your Sunday morning to say why you care.</p>

	<p>If you can come to this meeting, I will send you prep information and an agenda. I will also talk to you by phone to answer any questions. Before the meeting we will meet at a coffee shop for a brief final prep.</p>

	<p>Please note that we will have two experts at the meeting who will be able to answer technical questions. The meeting will focus on two types of legislation, carbon pricing and raising the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) - the amount of renewable energy that utilities are required to supply to consumers.</p>

	<p>I apologize for the late notice - we do not have much time so please <a href="maryjomaffei22@gmail.com"> contact me</a> or <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeE8xbySk_hMXBEZQvgMCNUucxBeLjaJNQAuWJwqn4rocqOdw/viewform">fill out this constituent form</a> as soon as you can! Thank you.</p>

	<p>Sincerely,</p>

	<p>Mary Jo Maffei<br>
