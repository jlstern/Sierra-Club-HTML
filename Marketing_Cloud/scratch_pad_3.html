<p style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-size: small;">Dear Friend,</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-size: small;">National Grid has proposed another fracked gas pipeline in Massachusetts! This one would go through the Back Bay and South End of Boston.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-size: small;">The City of Boston&rsquo;s Public Improvement Commission (PIC) will be holding a <strong>public hearing</strong> about the project this <strong>Thursday, October 19th at 10:00 AM in Room 801 of City Hall</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-size: small;">They need to hear from you! Will you attend and provide a comment on why this pipeline is bad for Boston?</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><a title="RSVP" href="https://sierra.secure.force.com/events/details?formcampaignid=7010Z000001OrghQAC" target="_blank">CLICK HERE TO RSVP</a></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-size: small;">Talking Points:<br /></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-size: small;">Pipelines pollute our water and air, and pose dangers to our health. The fracked gas they transport contains toxic chemicals such as lead, arsenic, and mercury. When pipelines leak, methane and other dangerous pollutants are released into the air. These pollutants have been linked to asthma and other serious health issues.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: small;">Natural Gas is not cleaner than other fossil fuels when you take into account the leaks and emissions related to extraction, transportation, and distribution. Methane is estimated to be 85 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Therefore natural gas should not be considered a &ldquo;bridge fuel.&rdquo;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: small;">Massachusetts doesn&rsquo;t want or need another dirty fracked gas pipeline. How do we know this? A 2015 study commissioned by Attorney General Maura Healey &ndash; the chief ratepayer advocate in the state &ndash; found that more gas pipelines are not needed to meet future energy demand, and that investment in energy efficiency and demand response would result in the greatest customer savings.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><span style="font-size: small;">It&rsquo;s also always great to add a personal story! What brought you here today? How would this pipeline impact your life?<br />We need your support! Can we count on you to show up at the <strong>public hearing on Thursday, October 19th</strong>?</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em"><span style="font-size: small;">Also -- as a member of the Boston Clean Energy Coalition, Sierra Club is co-hosting a <strong>vigil to spread awareness</strong> about the pipeline on <strong>Monday October 16th, at 1:00 PM in front of the Boston Public Library</strong> (corner of Dartmouth &amp; Boylston St). Please join us and wear green to stand in solidarity against the pipeline.</span></p>
