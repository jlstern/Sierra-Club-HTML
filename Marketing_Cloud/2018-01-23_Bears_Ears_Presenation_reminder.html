	<p>Dear %%[ if not empty(@fname) then ]%%%%= v(@fname) =%%%%[ else ]%%Friend%%[ endif ]%%,</p>

	<p>This <strong>Thursday (Jan 25)</strong>, join the MA Sierra Club to learn about Utah's endangered canyons. The Trump administration recently released a plan to reduce the Bears Ears National Monument by up to 85%! This action is part of a larger effort from the Trump Administration to sell out America’s public lands and waters to fossil fuel development.</p>

	<p><strong>About the presenter:</strong><br>
	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.harveyhalpern.com/">Harvey Halpern</a> been hiking in the most remote parts of Utah’s canyon country for nearly 40 years. He specializes in off-trail long trips, upwards to 33 days. He has been part of numerous first descents of technical canyons, has named canyons and even has a canyon named after him (Hard Day Harvey).</p>

	<p><strong>Join the effort:</strong><br> 
	President Trump does not have the legal authority to eliminate sections of Bears Ears. HOWEVER, only congress can establish a National Conservation Area, meaning that protection for Bears Ears is far from certain.</p>

	<p>Bears Ears is <strong>only the first of many</strong> National Monuments that are under threat by the Trump Administration. Two monuments in Maine and Massachusetts are under revision as well.</p>

	<p>We Sierra Club love our national monuments both Bears Ears and others and <strong>we stand with the overwhelming majority of Americans</strong> in opposing these attacks on our history, favorite outdoor pastimes and cultural and natural treasures. </p>
