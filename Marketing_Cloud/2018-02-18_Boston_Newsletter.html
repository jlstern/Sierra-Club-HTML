			<h2>Feb 15 - Speak Up for Clean Transportation</h2>
			<p>As you probably know, Volkswagen was found guilty of intentionally dodging fuel standards by installing emissions-cheating devices in their vehicles. Massachusetts will receive about $75 million in settlement funds to help mitigate the damage VW caused. The Mass Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) is hosting two listening sessions in Boston to gather your input on the best use of these mitigation funds. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/www.sierraclub.org/files/sce/massachusetts-chapter/Joint%20eNGO%20Response%20to%20MassDEP%20VW%20Mitigation%20Trust%20Survey%20(7.18.2017).pdf">You can read our recommendations here</a>, as well as the <a href="https://twitter.com/MassSierraClub/status/958038450174943234">recommendations of 38 state elected officials.</a> MassDEP needs to hear from you too! <a target="_blank" href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/MassDEPStakeholderMeetings">Click here to RSVP.</a></p>

			<h2>March 31 - Revitalizing Greater Boston Ecosystems Conference</h2>

			<p>Ecosystems across our highly developed region are threatened by climate change. But these ecosystems are also our best allies. Local ecosystems can help us to weather the coming climate shocks, and there is much that we can do to revitalize them in our yards, streets, neighborhoods, parks, wetlands and waters. Learn about current efforts and new possibilities for revitalizing ecosystems. Sponsored by Sierra Club's Greater Boston Group and Biodiversity for a Liveable Climate, this conference will take place at Harvard University on Saturday, March 31st, 9am - 4pm. Tickets will be $10 to help offset expenses. <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/revitalizing-ecosystems-in-greater-boston-to-survive-climate-change-tickets-42952016638">Click here to sign-up now!</a></p>
