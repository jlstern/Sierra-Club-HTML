<!-- <p dir="ltr">Our dependence on dirty energy like oil and gas pollutes our air and water and harms the health of Massachusetts’ communities. Pipelines threaten our safety and our green spaces. Pollution from fossil fuels are changing our climate and increasing the frequency of droughts, severe storms, and other damaging weather events.</p>

<p dir="ltr">We need local action across the globe to advance our clean energy future – and that's why Mass Power Forward has decided to launch local clean energy campaigns across the state.</p>

<p dir="ltr">This unprecedented threat we face is also an unprecedented opportunity to create clean energy jobs, develop sustainable neighborhoods, and clean up our air and water. With our state and federal governments considering multi-billion dollar investments in fossil fuels, now more than ever we need to lead a clean energy revolution from the ground up and show that we can get 100% of our energy from clean sources. &nbsp;We can live better lives while creating good jobs, making great neighborhoods, and saving our green space.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>How Does Local Energy Help Everyone?</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">A switch from dirty to clean energy helps communities in several ways:</p>

<ul>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">It puts the power and the solutions in the hands of our communities</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">It creates sustainable jobs - clean energy solutions generate good safe jobs</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">It protects green spaces - investing in clean energy and energy efficiency will help prevent the expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure that threatens our natural landscapes</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">it cleans up our air and water - the more clean energy we put into place, the more dirty energy we can take offline</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Is the transition to clean energy possible?</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">Though a 100% clean energy future may sound daunting, it is possible with strong local action. Emerging as environmental leaders, communities including San Diego CA, Burlington VT, Boulder CO, and Rochester MN have all committed to 100% renewable energy along with major corporations such as Amazon, Google, and Johnson &amp; Johnson. <a href="http://www.environmentmassachusettscenter.org/reports/mac/we-have-power-0" style="text-decoration:none;"><u>Studies from major universities and institutions</u></a> — including Stanford University, the University of Delaware, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the U.S. Earth System Research Laboratory, and others — have shown that a 100% clean electric grid is within reach.</p>

<p>As we transition to 100% clean energy, as much of that energy as possible should come from local sources, like wind and solar installations in New England. That way, we can maximize the economic and environmental benefits for our communities, while ensuring that the dollars we spend are resulting in more clean energy on the grid.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Why local action and local projects?</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">Local action and local projects are good for two reasons: they let your community make choices based on your values and priorities, and they prove that climate change solutions work. Your town gets to decide what our energy future looks like, and prove to state policy makers that communities can . We can set the example at the local level and show that it is possible to clean up our state and transition to a clean energy future!</p>

<p dir="ltr"><em>Across Massachusetts, cities and towns are already leading the way towards 100 percent renewable energy</em>. For example:</p>

<ul>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">New Bedford has installed 16 megawatts of solar to power its municipal facilities, and more than a third of the vehicles in its municipal fleet are electric vehicles.</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">Cambridge has adopted a Net Zero Action Plan, laying out steps for the city to reduce carbon emissions from its buildings by 70 percent by 2040.</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">Sutton has received $440,000 in funding for energy efficiency upgrades for municipal buildings through the Green Communities program.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
