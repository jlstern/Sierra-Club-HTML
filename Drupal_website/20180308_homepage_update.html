<p><em>“Boston will return to its historic boundary lines,” said Emily Norton, director of the Massachusetts chapter of the Sierra Club and a city councilor in Newton, west of Boston. Talk and theories tossed around at a commission meeting won’t stop it, she said.</em></p>

<p><em>“You see the talk, but you don’t see the action,” said Norton. “They’re talking about spending billions of dollars for a sea wall and dikes, hardening the shore. Boston should be doing more. Massachusetts is a state that others follow, and Massachusetts has to do more. We have to take steps to reverse this and get off of fossil fuels.”</em></p>
