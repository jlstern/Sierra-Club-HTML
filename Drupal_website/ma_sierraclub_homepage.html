<h1>January 24: Public Hearing on Trump's New Federal Offshore Drilling Program!</h1>

<p>The Trump Administration has made good on its commitment to big oil by presenting an ecologically devastating proposal that seeks to open over 90% of the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf to new offshore drilling, putting our nationâ€™s coastal communities, beaches, surf breaks, and marine ecosystems at serious risk of catastrophic oil spills, economic and environmental decimation.</p>

<h3 style="color: blue;">THE TIME TO ACT IS NOW!<br>
#DefendOurCoasts, #ProtectOurCoasts from #OffshoreDrilling!</h3>

<p>MASS RESIDENTS: Please attend a rally outside the Hyatt and then join for the public meeting on 1/24 in Boston to speak out against the proposal!</p>

<p>
	<strong>WHEN:</strong> Wednesday, January 24, 2018 from 3-4:30pm<br>
	<strong>WHERE:</strong> Meet at the main entry to the Hyatt, at One Avenue de Lafayette, Boston, MA 02111
</p>

<p>Meet wearing light blue and bring a poster against offshore drilling!</p>

<h1>BREAKING - <a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/press-releases/2018/01/trump-administration-releases-plan-recklessly-expand-drilling-america-s?scv=1516295764957">Trump Administration Releases Plan to Recklessly Expand Drilling off America's Coasts</a></h1>

<div style="size: 16px;">
<p>The Atlantic has been off-limits to new offshore drilling for decades. But oil and gas companies are relentlessly exploring for new reserves, across the Atlantic coast and Massachusetts. The gulf stream connects our states, so a spill off Maryland can wreak havoc on Massachusetts coastal waters and beaches.</p>

<p>It's literally unimaginable, and so we must fight them with all we've got: our legal team, our legislative advocates, and our grassroots muscle. But we need your support today to do it.</p>
